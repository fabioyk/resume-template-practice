# Resume Template HTML5/CSS3 Practice
The objective of this project was to try to clone the layout of https://creativemarket.com/ikonome/686585-Material-Resume-Blue/screenshots/#screenshot2, using HTML and CSS only.

Many of the tools and techniques were used for my first time here.

## Tools and Techniques used
* SASS
  * Used SASS as my CSS preprocessor together with autoprefixer.
* Gulp
  * Gulp was used to watch my files and automatically compile my CSS, and also using an autoprefixer for the extensive use of flexboxes.
* ITCSS
  * Inverted Triangle CSS was used as our CSS architecture and make our CSS scalable.
* Flexbox
  * Flexbox was used extensively throughout the website, to create the desired layouts and make them easily responsive and mobile ready.
